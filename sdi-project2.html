<p>My story consists of a one of the kind hunter that started from the bottom.
    His name is The BladeBow Hunter and like his name he wields a unlike weapon
    that consists of two weapons in one, an indestructible blade that can be
    wielded at the bottom and at the middle, and a unbreakable string that when
    puled it starches without braking and the pressure it has is unimaginable to
    through any arrow at least 5,000 yards. The Bladebow Hunter hunts for people
    and monsters depending on the mission he gets. He goes to a Mission board to
    get a mission. His attack power is 370 points per close combat attacks and
    260 points per long range. Two missions catch his eye, one is of a Gunner
    called Gilbert the killer gunner witch has 2,700 hit points and its weak
    against close combat and strong against long range attacks. If he choses the
    gunner and defeat him he could get 1,800 exp. points. The other one is a
    monster called The Scarpler witch has 3,000 hit points and its weak against
    long rage attacks and strong against close combat but his movements are
    pretty fast and difficult to hit, but not impossible. If he choses the
    monster and defeats him he would get 2,100 exp. points.    </p>
