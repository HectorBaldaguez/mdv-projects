    <h2>Project 2</h2>

<p>My story consists of a one of the kind hunter that started from the bottom.
    His name is The BladeBow Hunter and like his name he wields a unlike weapon
    that consists of two weapons in one, an indestructible blade that can be
    wielded at the bottom and at the middle, and a unbreakable string that when
    puled it starches without braking and the pressure it has is unimaginable to
    through any arrow at least 5,000 yards. The Bladebow Hunter hunts for people
    and monsters depending on the mission he gets. He goes to a Mission board to
    get a mission. Two missions catch his eye, one is of a Gunner called Gilbert
    the killer gunner. The other one is a monster called The Scarpler.</p>
